# Bike Sharing Dataset Tasks

### Introduction

This project which I completed for my Masters explores various tasks using the Bike Sharing dataset, which contains information about the daily count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the Capital bike share system, along with corresponding weather and seasonal information.

### Usage Instructions

To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn).
3. Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset (day.csv).
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform various tasks and visualize the data.

### Tasks Implemented

#### 1. Data Exploration and Analysis

1. **Average Daily Counts by Month for 2011 and 2012**
   - Calculate average daily counts grouped by month for 2011 and 2012.
   - Visualize the results.

2. **Average Monthly Counts by Season for 2011 and 2012**
   - Calculate average monthly counts grouped by season for 2011 and 2012.
   - Visualize the results.

#### 2. Data Comparison

1. **Difference in Average Counts Between 2011 and 2012**
   - Calculate the difference in average monthly counts between 2011 and 2012.
   - Visualize the results.

#### 3. Seasonal Analysis

1. **Season with the Highest Total Rental Bikes**
   - Find the season with the highest total rental bikes for casual and registered users separately for each year.

2. **Top 3 Months with the Lowest Counts**
   - Find the top 3 months with the lowest counts of total rental bikes for casual and registered users separately for each year.

#### 4. Data Visualization

1. **Yearly-wise Distribution of Counts**
   - Plot the distribution of rental bike counts for 2011 and 2012 separately.

2. **Working Day-wise Distribution of Counts**
   - Plot the distribution of rental bike counts for 2011 and 2012 separately based on working days.

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Plot the correlation between daily bike rental count and environmental settings, including weather, temperature, humidity, and windspeed.

#### 5. Prediction

1. **Prediction of Daily Bike Rental Count**
   - Train linear regression models to predict daily bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings.
   - Visualize trendlines for each environmental setting.
   - Generate predictions for specific environmental conditions.
